/* 10. Some authors have a contract, while others don't - it's indicated in the

     Select all the states and cities where there are 2 or more contracts 
     overall */

Select State, city, sum(contract)

/* 
The main difference between WHERE and HAVING is that:
    - the WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering most records
    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from 
      an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)
